## Background
I built my blog on July 27, 2017 by using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). After that I post some articles on it, not too many, just 4 posts, then I dropped it. The latest post was post on July 27, 2018. This means that the blog was only active for one year, then it became inactive although it was still online. There are two reasons for this result. One is that I was too lazy to update it, the other is that I tried to write posts in English so that more people can understand, however I am not native English speaker, my English skill is not good enough for me to write posts. Sometimes I have something to write down, I can express it well in Chinese easily but when I try using English, I can't even express what I want to say well.

And today, June 25, 2022, after 4 years since the last post, I decide to update my blog. I would call it a *new start*. I am not going to add new posts for it, instead, I am going to delete all the old contents and the rebuild it. One of the reasons is I got bored about [the previous theme](https://github.com/klugjo/hexo-theme-anodyne). I chose a simple theme when I built it, but now I think it is too simple although I like simple stuff, I prefer a more beautiful one. Another reason is that I am not satisfied with some of my post, not all, just some, but I still want to make a new start. I may be regretted if I just delete them so I [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20211223093307/http://dqwyy.moe/) them at Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which is a really useful website for archiving. I keep the GitHub repository too. Maybe I will move one of two posts to the new blog someday after doing some editing but not now. For the new theme, I considered using [Minos](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-minos) by ppoffice initially but its layout didn't render correctly, some CSS files didn't seem to load successfully. I gave up after several attempts to fix it. Finally I decided to use [Icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus), another work by the same author. Besides, I will also change the domain of my blog to a subdomain. I used second-level domain directly for the blog before but now I think it should be used for a home about me page instead, so a `blog.` subdomain is adopted.

## Install and configuration
Firstly, I created a empty folder for the blog, later actions will be taken in that folder. Locate into the folder, then install Hexo with the following command. I will use [cnpm](http://www.npmmirror.com/) here, which is a mirror site in China for npm, in order to get better Internet connection experience.

```
npm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
sudo cnpm install -g hexo-cli
hexo init
cnpm install
```

Download the theme [Icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) to the theme folder of Hexo and enable it at `_config.yml`. Install dependent packages.

```
cnpm install semver
cnpm install --save bulma-stylus@0.8.0 hexo@^5.0.2 hexo-log@^2.0.0 hexo-component-inferno@^0.14.0 inferno@^7.3.3 inferno-create-element@^7.3.3
```

Edit `_config.yaml` and `_config.icarus.yml`. These are some regular configurations, like removing unnecessary widgets, so I won't talk about it in detail. I still have to do some tweak for the theme outside the configuration file, which means I have to touch the styles files.

### Change layout width
At the default layout, the profile card widget is too wide and the main area is too narrow. Do the following changes to these two files.

```diff ./themes/icarus/layout/common/widgets.jsx
 function getColumnSizeClass(columnCount) {
     switch (columnCount) {
         case 2:
-            return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-4-widescreen';
+            return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-3-widescreen';
         case 3:
             return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-3-widescreen';
     }
     return '';
 }
```

```diff ./themes/icarus/layout/layout.jsx
 <div class={classname({
     column: true,
     'order-2': true,
     'column-main': true,
     'is-12': columnCount === 1,
-    'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-8-widescreen': columnCount === 2,
+    'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-9-widescreen': columnCount === 2,
     'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-6-widescreen': columnCount === 3
 })} dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: body }}></div>
```

### Change fonts
Edit the following files to change font family, font weight and font size. The default style doesn't use any bold font weight, that is not my type. Besides, categories are stylized as uppercase automatically, but I am using [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) codes as the categories to state the language of the post, and it should be in lowercase.

```diff ./themes/icarus/include/style/base.styl
- $family-sans-serif ?= Ubuntu, Roboto, 'Open Sans', 'Microsoft YaHei', sans-serif
+ $family-sans-serif ?= 'Nimbus Sans', 'FreeSans', 'Arial', 'Roboto', 'Yunlin Sans', 'Source Han Sans KR', 'Noto Sans CJK KR', 'Microsoft JhengHei', sans-serif

- $family-code ?= 'Source Code Pro', monospace, 'Microsoft YaHei'
+ $family-code ?= 'FreeMono', 'Courier New', monospace, 'Yunlin Sans', 'Source Han Sans KR', 'Noto Sans CJK KR', 'Microsoft JhengHei'
```

```diff ./themes/icarus/layout/common/article.jsx
- {page.title !== '' ? <h1 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile">
+ {page.title !== '' ? <h1 class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile" style="font-weight:bold;">

- {page.layout !== 'page' ? <div class="article-meta is-size-7 is-uppercase level is-mobile">
+ {page.layout !== 'page' ? <div class="article-meta is-size-7 level is-mobile">
      <div class="level-left">
          {/* Creation Date */}
-         {page.date && <span class="level-item" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
+         {page.date && <span class="level-item is-uppercase" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
              __html: _p('article.created_at', `<time dateTime="${date_xml(page.date)}" title="${new Date(page.date).toLocaleString()}">${date(page.date)}</time>`)
          }}></span>}

          {/* author */}
-         {page.author ? <span class="level-item"> {page.author} </span> : null}
+         {page.author ? <span class="level-item"><i class="fas fa-user mr-1"></i>{page.author}</span> : null}
          {/* Categories */}
          {page.categories && page.categories.length ? <span class="level-item">
              {(() => {
                  const categories = [];
                  page.categories.forEach((category, i) => {
-                     categories.push(<a class="link-muted" href={url_for(category.path)}>{category.name}</a>);
+                     categories.push(<a class="link-muted" href={url_for(category.path)}><i class="fas fa-globe mr-1"></i>{category.name}</a>);
                      if (i < page.categories.length - 1) {
                          categories.push(<span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;</span>);
                      }
                  });
                  return categories;
              })()}
          </span> : null}
```

```diff ./themes/icarus/include/style/article.styl
-    .categories
-        @extend .is-uppercase

 h1
     font-size: 1.75em
+    font-weight: bold;
 h2
     font-size: 1.5em;
+    font-weight: bold;
```

```diff ./themes/icarus/include/style/navbar.styl
 .navbar-item
     display: flex
     align-items: center
     padding: $navbar-item-padding-v $navbar-item-padding-h
     margin: $navbar-item-margin-v $navbar-item-margin-h
+    font-weight: bold
```

### Change date format
The default date format is in a relative style, like *x* days ago. This is not my type, I want to change it to the absolute style, an exact date.
```diff ./themes/icarus/source/js/main.js
     if (typeof moment === 'function') {
         $('.article-meta time').each(function() {
-            $(this).text(moment($(this).attr('datetime')).fromNow());
+            $(this).text(moment($(this).attr('datetime')).format("MMMM DD, YYYY"));
         });
     }
```

### Change copyright footer
The default copyright is "Â© 2022 dqwyy  Powered by Hexo & Icarus". I don't want to use the copyright symbol here because I would like to release my posts to the Public Domain by using the [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (CC0) license.

```diff ./themes/icarus/layout/common/footer.jsx
- <a class="footer-logo is-block mb-2" href={siteUrl}>
-     {footerLogo}
- </a>
- <p class="is-size-7">
-     <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `&copy; ${siteYear} ${author || siteTitle}` }}></span>

```

### Change the profile widget
I am not satisfied with the current profile widget, I would like to do the following changes.

- Make the author name bold.
- I am going to show my email address at the `author_title` field, this can be done at the configuration file of the theme. I would like use HTML entities to show the address in order to avoid spam bot, but they can't be rendered, that is, `&#64;` is shown as `&#64;` instead of `@`. I have ever considered showing it as a social platform button, using a `mailto:` link. However, I don't think there are so many people using a email client, maybe more people prefer using a web version. As for me, I resist using a email client, I will just use the web version, since it's *official*.
- There is a "Follow" button, that is not detailed enough. Follow what? Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or other social platform? It is also duplicated with the following social platform buttons. So I am going to change the text "Follow" to "About Me", and then make the hyperlink to my about-me page (not sure how to call it, home page or profile page?), which is still under construction.
- The social platform button is too small, I am going to increase the size.

```diff ./themes/icarus/layout/widget/profile.jsx
- {author ? <p class="title is-size-4 is-block" style={{'line-height': 'inherit'}}>{author}</p> : null}
+ {author ? <p class="title is-size-4 is-block" style={{'line-height': 'inherit'}}><b>{author}</b></p> : null}

- {authorTitle ? <p class="is-size-6 is-block">{authorTitle}</p> : null}
+ <p class="is-size-6 is-block"><i class="fas fa-envelope mr-1"></i>&#109;&#101;<span style="display:none">ä½ä½</span>&#64;<span style="display:none">PLACEHOLDER</span>&#100;&#113;&#119;&#121;&#121;<span>.</span>&#109;&#111;&#101;</p>

- <a class="level-item button is-primary is-rounded" href={followLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener">{followTitle}</a>
+ <a class="level-item button is-primary is-rounded" href={followLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABOUT ME</a>

- {'icon' in link ? <i class={link.icon}></i> : link.name}
+ {'icon' in link ? <i class={link.icon} style="font-size:30px; color:#1c78e3;"></i> : link.name}
```

## Deploy
By now, the configuration is almost complete. I still want to tweak more, such as the color of the hyperlinks and so on, but it will take some time for me to do the research because I know nothing about ReactJSX or Stylus, which seem to be different from regular CSS. So this is for now. It's time to deploy it to GitHub and make the blog public and accessible.
